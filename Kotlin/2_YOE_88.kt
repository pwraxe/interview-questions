==BASICS

1. What is Kotlin?

2. Why is Kotlin preferred over Java?
-> NPE, Concise code, Removes boilerplate codes, Interoperable

3. What are the key features of Kotlin?
-> NPE, Concide, HigherOrder, Extension, Lambda Functions, Coroutine, OS

4. What are Kotlinâ€™s primary data types?
-> Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, Boolean, Char

5. What is the difference between var and val in Kotlin?
-> var: Mutable | val: Immutable

==OOP

6. What is an object in Kotlin?
-> Instance of that class which contains actual data and behaviour of that class

7. What are the types of constructors in Kotlin?
-> Primary and Secondary

8. Explain the data class in Kotlin.

9. What is the sealed class in Kotlin?
-> Restrict Inheritance Hierarchy, Compiler knows all hierarchy at compile time, sealed keyword, Should be in same file

10. What is the object keyword used in Kotlin?
-> Object is a Special keyword in kotlin 
-> It acts like a static in Java
-> We can directly access properties and methods directly object name
-> It is singleton by default
-> It is used to create singleton objects, declare anonymous classes and object expression

==FUNCTIONAL

11. What is a higher-order function in Kotlin?
-> A function that accepts and returns the lambda function

12. What is an extension function in Kotlin?

13. What is the lambda expression in Kotlin?
-> lambda function which can pass as arg or assign to a variable

14. What is the let function in Kotlin?
-> Let is scope function
-> Ideally it runs on nullable variable if it is not null
-> It cast the null variable to not null for data
-> It provides it as the current scope context

15. What are inline functions in Kotlin?
-> Copy the body of the inline function at the caller's place
-> It reduces calling the same function again and again
-> It improves performance and reduces memory occupation

==NULL SAFTY
16. How does Kotlin handle null values?
-> Kotlin does not support nullability by default
-> We have to make variables nullable explicitly
-> If we have a nullable variable then kotlin provides 4 different ways to handle null values
-> 1) Safe Call 2) Elvis Operator 3) Assertion 4) Let Block

17. What is the !! operator in Kotlin?
-> !! is an Assertion operator (Risky Operator)

18. What is the Elvis operator (?:) in Kotlin?
-> It is a short syntax to handle the null variable
-> If the nullable variable is not null then it returns as it else returns the default value
-> It is a more clean and concise way to handle nullable variable 

19. How can you handle null values using safe calls in Kotlin?
-> ?.

20. What is the purpose of letting in null safety?
-> Let is scope function which gives us `it` as the current scope context.
-> It executes a block of code only if the nullable variable is not null
-> It cast nullable to non-nullable to safely work on an object
-> It allows us to create weak references of an object


21. What are coroutines in Kotlin?
-> Concurrency Design Pattern, 
-> Writes Asynchronous code, w/o blocking main thread
-> Lauch Async,
-> suspend function


22. What is suspended in Kotlin?
-> can control (Start, Pause, Resume, Stop)
-> execute independently
-> call from the scope or other suspend function


23. What is the launch of Kotlin?
-> Launch is an Extension function of CoroutineScope
-> Use to create a new coroutine without blocking the main thread
-> It is fire and forgets the concept
-> We don't get results to return using the launch


24. What is async in Kotlin?
-> Async is the Extension function of CoroutineScope
-> Use to create a new coroutine without blocking the main thread
-> It is used when we want results back from a coroutine
-> It returns the Deferred type of object, use await to extract data from it


25. What is withContext in Kotlin?
-> It is a suspend function used to switch the context of the coroutine from one dispatcher to other
-> It can called from either coroutine scope or other suspend function
-> IT uses a dispatcher to switch the context

==KOTLIN COLLECTIONS

26. What is the difference between List and MutableList in Kotlin?
-> Both contain homo and heterogeneous element because both accept vararg
-> list is immutable hence we cannot add, remove or update elements from it, It is read-only.
-> mutableLits if mutable hence we can perform CRUD operation on it


27. How do you create an immutable list in Kotlin?
-> listOf()


28. How do you create a mutable list in Kotlin?
-> mutableListOf()


29. What is the difference between map and flatMap in Kotlin?
-> Map transforms each element into another object
-> Flatmap convert elements into a single result 

fun main() {
    val l1 = listOf(1,2,3)
    val l2 = listOf("abc","def","ghi")
    val res1 = l1.flatMap { l2 } //["abc","def","ghi", "abc","def","ghi", "abc","def","ghi"]
    val res2 = l2.flatMap { l1 } //[1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]
}


30. What is the purpose of the filter in Kotlin?
-> Filter is used to extract elements from the list based on a given condition


==ANDROID SPECIFIC QUESTION
31. Why use Kotlin for Android development?
-> Concise, NPE Handler, Interoperable, Rich in Functions


32. What is the difference between lateinit and lazy in Kotlin?
-> lateinit: late initialization, mutable, work only non-null variable,  
-> lazy: delegate property, immutable, work on nullable also


33. What is the purpose of a companion object in Kotlin?
-> Creating Static like fields
-> Makeing class singleton

34. What is the purpose of @Parcelize in Kotlin?
-> @Parcelize is an Android Annotation that makes data class Parcelable by generating boilerplate code


35. What is the purpose of @JvmStatic in Kotlin?
-> Direct Access of method in kotlin who annotate with @JvmStatic from JavaCode 

==ADVANCE CONCEPT
36. What is Kotlin DSL?
-> Domain Specific Language
-> When you have to solve Domain Specific problems then you use DSL
-> By Using Kotlin Language Feature (Lambda Expression, Extension Feature, infix etc.) you make your code more readable and more expressive for specific task 
-> Ex. creating config file, Building UI Layouts, define complex workflow


37. What is inline with noinline parameters?
-> inline: works on HOF, reduce function call, copy body at caller place
-> noinline: some param of HOF mark as noinline

38. What is the reified keyword in Kotlin?
-> To retain data info at runtime
-> It uses with inline keyword (inline function)
-> generic param erased info at compile time, to retain we use reified
-> fun <reified T> todo(t:T) {}

-> for((k,v) in map) || map.forEach {..}

59. Explain Kotlin Flow.
-> it is stream of data flow, that continuously emit the values asynchronously
-> It has producer and consumer
-> Producer: continuously produce value and add to stram
-> Consumer: It used to consume data from the stream 
-> ColdFlow: It emits value only when it is collected (each collector has its own instance of flow)
-> HotFlow: It continues emitting value even if not collected (multiple collector share same emission)
-> ShareFlow: Allow multiple collectors to share the same emission (don't have initial value)
-> StateFlow: It holds a single updated state (it has an initial value), the collector has the latest value

81. What are visibility modifiers in Kotlin?
-> Public, Private, Protected, Internal


82. What is crossinline in kotlin 
-> Crossinline is a modifier used with lambda parameter in inline function to prevent non-local returns 
-> Suppose you have a return in lambda function which is being passed as a param to the inline function
-> then return statement will return from local to parent function
-> but we wrote return just to exit lambda function, In such case, we use crossinline in inline function args
-> IMP: crossinline is useful when we need to write a return statement in lambda else no need for lambda


83. What is noinline
-> When lambda function calls from inline function kotlin auto makes that inline 
-> If we don't want then we can specify lambda args as noinline


84. What is an inline class in kotlin 
-> inline class in kotlin is a special type of class used to wrap data
-> This class is also called a value class
-> The main purpose of this class is to use less memory and improve the performance
-> Inline class has only a single param in the primary constructor
 
-> It is a special type of class that wraps a single value in class 
-> It has only a single value in its constructor
-> At compile time, a single value gets inline hence at run-time object is not created.


85. What is the difference between open and final in Kotlin?
-> Every class is final by default
-> Open keyword allows us to extend the class to its subclass


86. What is the difference between Any and Unit in Kotlin?
-> Any is the root class of the kotlin hierarchy similar to the Java Object class
-> Unit is function default return type if not specified same as void in Java


87. What is a primary constructor in Kotlin?
-> Primary constructors are used to initialized Object
-> It declares at the class header with an optional constructor keyword
-> Class properties are auto-initialized at the time of object creation
-> It also acts as getter and setter


88. Explain the use of it in Kotlin.
-> It is a single parameter optional name of the lambda expression


89. What is covariance and contravariance in Kotlin?
Answer:
Covariance: When a generic type can accept a subclass.
Contravariance: When a generic type can accept a superclass.
Answer: Covariance (out) allows a type to be more specific (subtypes), while contravariance (in) will enable it to be more general (supertypes).

interface Producer<out T> {
    fun produce(): T
}

interface Consumer<in T> {
    fun consume(item: T)
}
