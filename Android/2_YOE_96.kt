-> It is set of libraries classes and function from which developer can create app easly and effectivly
-> Main Component: ViewMode, LiveData, Room, Paging, Fragment Component, WorkManager


2. Explain the role of ViewModel in MVVM architecture.
-> View <--> ViewModel <--> Model

3. How do LiveData and MutableLiveData differ?
-> LiveData is read/Immutable only class

6. Describe the difference between onCreate() and onStart() in an Activity.
-> onCreate(): When activity created for first time
-> onStart(): WHen Activity about to visible


7. What is the role of ViewBinding and how is it different from findViewById()
-> ViewBinding and findViewById both are use to access views 
-> ViewBinding generates binding class so have direct access to views


8. What is the purpose of DataBinding and how is it different from ViewBinding?
-> DataBinding use to bind UI Component directly with data source
-> DataBinding allow two way binding, change in object will reflect in UI
-> ViewBinding generate classes which direct access to views in layout

-> DiffUtils is data class which use in recyclerView for updateing only data item if its equivalant data has been changed


26. What is a Custom View, and when should you create one?
-> CustomView is such view which does not come with android package, we need to create externally based on business requirements
-> CustomView can be create by extending view class and by overriding onDraw method


27. Explain how Adapter classes work in Android.
-> Adapter is intermediator between data and viwe layout, 
-> Adapter bind data to view


28. What is the role of the CoordinatorLayout?
-> CoordinateLayout is layout which manage behaviour of its childs
-> You also can customized behaviour of child views of coordinateLayout
-> It use for animating view, manage interaction between views for showing and hiding
-> It also use for animation purpose, 
-> When Complex UI elements wants to coordinate between each other then CoordinateLayout is used


29. What are Drawables, and how would you work with them programmatically?
-> Drawable is resource like image, vector, svg icon, shape
-> you can use drawable file statically and programmitically by setting icon, image to imageView, setting background


30. How do you support multiple screen sizes and densities in Android?
-> use resource qualifier (res/layout-mdpi, res/layout-hdpi, res/layout-xdpi)


Networking and APIs

31. How would you make a network request using Retrofit?
-> Add Dependecy > Sync
-> Declare Methods in interface

Interface
Retrofit Object
create<Interface>()
enque()


32. What is OkHttp and why is it often used with Retrofit?
-> It is HTTP client which support HTTP, HTTP2 and Websocket
-> It is use to handle network request
-> It work on worker thread so main thread remain responsive
-> we can use interceptor, authentication, logging as well


33. Explain how you would manage background tasks and network calls using Kotlin Coroutines.
-> Kotlin Coroutine provides different Dispatchers such as Main, IO, Default, Unconfied,
-> Dispatcher.IO use for network related operation any background task,

-> Show Loader, Use Retrofit Timeout setting, retry fail request, display message related to.


35.How do you implement caching with Retrofit?
-> Caching support in OkHTTP, which use to store chaching data in file 
-> Take file instance, and create Cache object with specified size
-> It uses file to store cache data along with custom size in MB

36. What is the purpose of the @Query annotation in Retrofit?
-> Passing Extra information in URL to Server such as get data from id
-> @Query annotation uses in function parameter which align to end of URL
-> Query annotation uses in GET Method 


37. What are the main differences between Volley and Retrofit?
-> Retrofit: Square | return Json object or array | more easier to work with data
-> Volley: Google | return json string | complex to work on object


40. What is the purpose of RESTful APIs, and how do you consume them in Android?
-> RESTful API design to use HTTP methods for CRUD operation, 
-> Consume them by making network request
 

Jetpack Compose (if experienced with Jetpack Compose)
========================================================
